**Requirement Analysis Document for CO2 Emission Monitoring Dashboard for SAIL Project**

**Prepared By:** [Preparer's Name]
**Date:** [Preparation Date]
**Version:** [Version Number]

**Executive Summary:**
The project aims to design and implement a CO2 Emission Monitoring Dashboard for SAIL. The primary objective is to capture, analyze and report CO2 emissions data from various sources. The system will improve monitoring and management of CO2 emissions, provide reliable information for third-party assurance, and assist in strategic planning for CO2 emission reduction.

**Requirements Gathering Approach:**
[Approach used to gather the project's requirements]

**Functional Requirements:**
1. **Data Capture Module:** Integration with various sources including ERP systems like SAP, legacy systems or manual input to capture necessary data.
2. **Data Analysis Module:** Ability to analyze captured data and calculate unit-wise and material-wise CO2 emissions.
3. **Report Generation Module:** A feature to generate and export reports for third-party assurance, with necessary data visualizations.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. **User Interface:** The dashboard should be user-friendly and intuitive.
2. **Compatibility:** The system should be compatible with existing ERP systems like SAP.
3. **Cloud-Based Solution:** To ensure scalability and flexibility, the solution should be cloud-based.
4. **Security:** Strong security measures should be in place to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data.

**Data Requirements:**
Data from various sources such as ERP systems, legacy systems, and manual input will be required. The specific data variables will be finalized as per the emission calculation needs.

**AI/ML Models:**
AI/Data Science models will be used for data analysis and pattern recognition to calculate CO2 emissions accurately. The specific models will be chosen considering data availability, complexity, and accuracy requirements.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
